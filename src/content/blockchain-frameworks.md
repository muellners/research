# Blockchain Frameworks around the globe

The blockchain frameworks are a software solution that simplifies the
development, deployment, and support of technically complex products. Usually,
the framework contains only the blockchain framework and its basic modules, and
all specific components are implemented by the developer based on them. Thereby,
a high development rate is achieved while maintaining the stability and
performance of the final product.

## 1. Hyperledger

Developer: Linux Foundation  
Founded: 2016  
Network Type: Public and Private  
Source model: Open Source   
In 2016, the Linux Foundation started the Hyperledger project. Hyperledger is
open-source and doesn’t support any cryptocurrency. It was designed as an
environment where different communities and individual developers can meet and
work together on blockchain technologies. The result of this cooperation is a
set of blockchain tools for building financial, healthcare, banking, IoT, supply
chain, and other projects. This project is not one tool but a set of libraries,
instruments, frameworks, and interfaces. The most well-known and commonly used
Hyperledger frameworks are: Hyperledger Sawtooth. Intel has created a blockchain
suite with a modular architecture based on the PoET consensus algorithm.
Hyperledger Iroha. Several Japanese companies cooperated to create this project.
The result is a mobile-oriented blockchain framework that’s easy to implement
into an existing solution. Hyperledger Fabric. Created by IBM, this is the most
famous instrument among all Hyperledger frameworks. Fabric is a great solution
for creating highly scalable apps. Hyperledger Burrow. This tool was designed by
Monax in cooperation with Intel. It operates as a permissioned Ethereum smart
contract blockchain node.

## 2. Ethereum

Developer: Ethereum Developers  
Founded: 2013  
Network Type: Public and Permissionless  
Source model: Open Source

Founded in late 2013, Ethereum is an open-source and blockchain based
distributed computing platform proposed by Vitalk Buterin, a 22-year old
Russian-Canadian programmer. Ethereum is known for running smart contracts on a
custom-built blockchain. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides the run-time
environment to smart contracts in Ethereum. Every node within the network has to
run an EVM implementation. Though enterprises have adopted Ethereum widely, it
is essential to understand that Ethereum is a public blockchain platform, built
for restricted access versus mass consumption. Moreover, it is the Proof of Work
based platform, which is comparatively slower in terms of speed. But it might
change its consensus algorithm to Proof of Stake in the coming years. Ethereum
has also built a large online support community to keep everyone up-to-date with
product enhancements and updates.

## 3. Multichain

expensive business transactions. The framework allows businesses to reduce
transaction and record-keeping costs and streamline business operations. Corda
is an open-source technology that can be used to store, manage, control, and
synchronize financial obligations between different organizations. It helps
organizations build an open network to transfer value directly with trust. And
you can get it all with complete privacy.

## 6. OpenChain

Developer: Coinprism  
Founded: 2000  
Network Type: Private Source model: Open Source

This framework was launched by Coinprism. It’s designed for issuing and managing
digital assets. The Openchain distributed ledger aims to meet the needs of
banking establishments and financial institutions. Openchain solutions allow
financial establishments to effectively manage all financial processes and
enhance anti-fraud and anti-money laundering systems. It’s a great option if you
need to optimize your organization’s infrastructure and adapt it to different
needs. Openchain relies on a partitioned consensus algorithm where every
instance has only one authority with the right to validate transactions. This
creates a client-server architecture which, as the framework developers claim,
is more reliable than the usual peer-to-peer architecture. The developers also
promise full control over the infrastructure with the required level of
transparency.

## 7. Exonum

dApps (Decentralized applications). The company distributed one billion ERC-20
tokens to ensure widespread distribution of their cryptocurrency and allow
anyone to use the EOS blockchain after it was released. The goal of the platform
is to offer decentralized application’s hosting, decentralized storage of
enterprise solutions and smart contract capability, solving the scalability
issues of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Also, it eliminates the fees for all users,
i.e., no one needs to pay to avail the benefits of a dApp based on EOS. EOS
accomplishes consensus by using multi-threading as well as a delegated
proof-of-stake algorithm. They have their own community forum named as EOS
Forum.

## 12. Stellar

Developer: Stellar Development Foundation  
Founded: 2014  
Network Type: Public and Private  
Source model: Open Source

Stellar is a distributed blockchain based ledger used for facilitating
cross-asset transfers of value. It can also deal with exchanges between
cryptocurrencies and fiat based currencies. It is possible to build banking
tools, smart devices and mobile wallets using the Stellar network. Stellar
Consensus Protocol (SCP) makes it possible to reach consensus without depending
on a closed system for recording financial transactions. Having a set of
provable safety properties, SCP optimizes for safety over liveness by halting
the progress of the network until a consensus can be reached in case of
misbehaving nodes or partitions. As compared to the decentralized proof-of-work
and proof-of-stake algorithms, SCP has modest financial and computing
requirements, reducing the barrier to entry and opening up the financial system
to new participants.

Neo was founded by the same duo who established blockchain R&D company OnChain
in Shanghai – Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. Designed to develop scalable
decentralized applications, the base asset of the NEO blockchain is NEO token.
The role of NEO token is to generate GAS tokens which can be used to pay
transaction fees to run applications on the network. Neo uses Delegated
Byzantine Fault Tolerance as its consensus algorithm. The creators of Neo
selected this protocol because it allows better performance and scaling as
compared to other consensus mechanisms.

## 15. Bitcoin

Developer: Satoshi Nakamoto  
Founded: 2009  
Network Type: Public  
Source model: Open Source

The framework of the first and most famous cryptocurrency in the world. It was
created in 2009 by a person or a group of people under the common pseudonym
Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin blockchain is the progenitor of a significant part of
the first twenty of cryptocurrencies. Now the Bitcoin framework is losing in
popularity with the rest of the blockchains, since it is old and slow. Bitcoin
has the largest capitalization and audience, and it also develops, as a
decentralized system - the community decides in which direction the network will
develop, what update to bring and how to wait.

## 16. IOTA

Developer: IOTA Foundation  
Founded: 2016  
Network Type: Public and Private  
Source model: Open Source

Platform, customized to the work of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a global
add-on over the normal Internet, whose users are not people of flesh and blood,
but digital devices - from electronic watches on your wrist to a blast furnace
in the production hall. The workshop itself can also be digitized and connected
to the IoT. In its structure, the IOTA framework is not similar to Ethereum,
Bitcoin, or other popular blockchains, since there is no traditional linear
block chain structure. This structure limits the scalability of the network, so
IOTA instead uses the Tangle algorithm: for the user to receive confirmation for
his transaction, he must confirm the transactions of two other users.
